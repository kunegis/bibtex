BibTex Files Used by Jérôme Kunegis
===================================

This is the bilbiography used by Jérôme Kunegis in papers and other
publications. 

These Bibtex entries do not contain all information possible. They
are shorted to the style of papers I write.  Unused keys are "commented
out" by prefixing the key name with "_".

Other Rules
-----------

* Use `single quotes' when the title of a work contains quotes.
* All files are in UTF-8.  Sometimes, Bibtex forces us to use Latex
  encoding, but we avoid that as much as possible.  Use UTF-8.  
* Use title case for title, even if many BibTex styles don't do it.  It
  doesn't hurt for styles that don't need it, and is necessary for
  styles that need it.  Title case is e.g. "The Story of a Donkey".
  Words that should always be capitalized in a title are put in braces,
  e.g., "The Story of a {French} Donkey".
