BibTex Files Used by Jérôme Kunegis
===================================

This is the bibliography used by Jérôme Kunegis in papers and other
publications.

These Bibtex entries do not contain all information possible. They
are shorted to the style of papers I write.  Unused keys are "commented
out" by prefixing the key name with "_". 


Name Conventions
----------------

This is how we write certain types of names: 

LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME von [German]   
van LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME [Dutch]    
FIRSTNAME Van LASTNAME  [Belgian]  
FIRSTNAME De LASTNAME   [Belgian]


Citing conventions
------------------

* [27]                    Reference [27]
* [27|12]                 Reference [12] of reference [27]
* [27:3]                  Page 3 of reference [27] 
* [27:Algorithm 3], etc.  Algorithm 3 of reference [27]
* [27(4)]                 Equation (4) of reference [27] 
* [27.2]                  Section 2 of reference [27]


Abbreviations
-------------

We follow ISO 4.  

ISO 4 is only used on journal, conference and publisher names, but not
in article names. 

The symbol '&' is only used in publisher names.  In journal names, we
use 'and'.  

Publisher names are often abbreviated to a single word, e.g. "Springer",
"Wiley". 

For proceedings, we omit words such as "of"/"the".  For instance, we
write "Proc. Int. Conf. on Machine Learning". 


Other Rules
-----------

* Use `single quotes' when the title of a work contains quotes.
* All files are in UTF-8.  Sometimes, Bibtex forces us to use Latex
  encoding, but we avoid that as much as possible.  Use UTF-8.  If
  necessary, we us a Stu rule to transcode the files. 
* Use title case for titles, even if many BibTex styles map it back to
  sentence case.  It doesn't hurt for styles that don't need it, and is
  necessary for styles that do need it.  Title case is e.g. "The Story
  of a Donkey".  Words that should always be capitalised in a title are
  put in braces, e.g., "The Story of a {French} Donkey".
