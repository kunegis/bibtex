#: Metric learning:  given a graph with positive and negative edges, learn an embedding into a low-dimensional space such that d(i,j)&lt;u when i and j and connected by a positive edge and d(i,j)&gt;l when they are connected by a negative edge, with u>0 and l>0.
#: At the same time, they search a kernel K that is a spectral transformation of the Laplacian L which is monotonous:  i.e. if 0 ≤ λ<sub>1</sub> ≤ λ<sub>2</sub>≤… are the Laplacian eigenvalues, then the spectral transformation f satisfies f(λ<sub>i</sub>) ≥ f(λ<sub>j</sub>) iff λ<sub>i</sub> ≤ λ<sub>j</sub>.
